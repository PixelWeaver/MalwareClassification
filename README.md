# RNN-based Malware Classification
Malware classification using snapshot of system metrics and recurrent neural networks

## Data collection
Data collection conducted relying on [VirusShare](https://www.virusshare.com) samples run in [Cuckoo](https://cuckoosandbox.org/) sandbox (Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, VirtualBox machinery).
A snapshot of system metrics of the sandbox is taken every second.

Metrics collected are :
- cpu use percentage (user, system, idle, interrupt, dpc)
- virtual memory (total, available, used, free)
- swap memory (total, used, free, percent, sin, sout)
- disk i/o (read_count, write_count, read_bytes, write_bytes, read_time, write_time)
- net i/o (bytes_sent, bytes_recv, packets_sent, packets_recv, errin, errout, dropin, dropout)
- running processes' ids (pid)
